      <description>If you are looking at NFL teams that with the most success in recent years, the Jacksonville Jaguars are going to be near the very bottom. They have struggled with winning games in recent years, and there hasnâ€™t been a whole lot to cheer for.During the 2010s, the Jaguars ended up going 51-109 for a winning percentage of .319. That was good enough to put them in 31st out of 32 teams.</description>

      <description>Nebraska Basketball had a poor 2021-2022 season, but if you were going to point to a single bright spot, it would probably be Bryce McGowens. The Freshman from South Carolina was the highest-rated recruit in Nebraska Basketball history and contributed heavily on a team that had few play-makers.
McGowens has been on the radar of NBA teams since he was in high school, such is the life of being a highly rated recruit.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
